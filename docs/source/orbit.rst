Orbits
------

In this section we will describe how to integrate individual
stellar orbits, display and analyze them. Be aware that
although 3D orbits can be computed the number of utilities to
analyze them is rather limited.

Orbits are normally stored in datafile (see also
{\it orbit(5NEMO)}), and a close conceptual relationship exists
between a (single-particle type) {\bf snapshot} and an {\bf orbit}:
an orbit is an ordered series of phase-space coordinates
whereas a snapshot is a series of particles with no particular
order, but all at the same time.

Since orbits will be computed in an analytical potential, we assume for
the remainder of this section that you have familiarized yourself with
how to supply potentials to orbit integrator programs. They all share
the same triple ``potname=, potpars=, potfile=`` keyword
interface, as described in Section \ref{s:potential}. Many
examples of the tricky {\tt potpars=} keyword are given in Appendix
\ref{a:potential}.

Initializing
~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are a few programs with which orbits can be initialized:


- **mkorbit** is the most straightforward program. You can give
  simply give it all 6 phase space coordinates, and an orbit file
  consisting of this one point is generated. It is also possible to give
  the potential in which the particle is to move, and 5 phase space
  coordinates plus the energy, or even 4 phase space coordinates and the
  energy plus the total angular momentum or angular momentum along the Z
  axis (for axisymmetric systems).

Let's start with an example of creating a simple orbit by itself
with no associated potential.

.. code-block::

  % mkorbit out=orb1 x=1 y=0 z=0 vx=0 vy=0.2 vz=0
  ### Warning [mkorbit]: Potential potname= not used; set etot=0.0

- **perorb** is a program that for given initial conditions
  (similar to the ones described in {\tt mkorbit} above) attempts
  to calculate periodic orbits in that potential. The output file
  will be a file with one (or more) orbits. This is a bit of an
  advanced program, and will not be covered here.


- **stoo** is a program that can take a particle position from
  a snapshot, and turn it into an orbit. For example, sampling some
  initial conditions from the positions of stars in a Plummer sphere,
  we could use the following small C-shell code to find some
  statistical properties of this selected set of 
  orbits\footnote{For the careful reader:
  {\tt mkplummer} and {\tt potname=plummer} actually
  have different units, and as such this experiment is not 
  properly set up.}

.. code-block::

    mkplummer out=p100 nbody=p100
    foreach i (`nemoinp 0:100:10`)    
        stoo in=p100 out=orb$i ibody=$i
        orbint orb$i orb$i.out 10000 0.01 10000 potname=plummer
        orbstat orb$i.out
    end


The reverse program, {\tt otos} turns an orbit into a snapshot, and 
may come in handy since the snapshot package has far more advanced
analysis programs.


Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~

- **orbint** integrates orbits from given initial conditions. If the
  input orbit has more than 1 step, the last step is taken as the
  initial conditions. Although the {\tt potname=, potpars=, potfile=}
  keywords can be given, if the input orbit contains...

- **perorb** finds periodic orbits, and stores a full period which should
  close the orbit. This program finds periodic orbits in the XY plane
  (i.e. currently it will only find 2D orbits) by searching for the
  centers of invariant curves in the surface of section.


- **henyey** also finds periodic orbits, but uses Henyey's 
  method\footnote{see also van Albada \& Sanders, (1982, MNRAS, 201, 303)}.
  This program has however not been released to the public version of
  NEMO, and in fact it seem the source code was lost.


Display
~~~~~~~


- **orbplot** is the only orbit plotting program we currently have.
  For more sophisticated display {\tt tabplot} and/or
  {\tt snapplot} would have to be used after transforming the data.
  Also {\tt snapplot} uses the powerful {\it bodytrans} expression
  parser to plot arbitrary
  body related expressions, although {\tt orbplot} can
  handle both {\tt x, y, z} and {\tt vx, vy, vz} for the
  {\tt xvar=} and {\tt yvar=} keywords. An example of the output of
  {\tt orbplot} is given in Figure \ref{f:orbit1}.


Analysis
~~~~~~~~


- **orbstat** is an example of a simple program that reads orbits,
  and displays statistics of it's 2D (x-y-) coordinates: 
  maximum extent, as well as statistics of the angylar momentum.
  This program is not suited for 3D orbits yet.

.. code-block::

   % orbint orb1 orb1.long 
   % orbstat orb1.out

- **orbsos** computes surface of section coordinates. Since this program
  does not plot, but produces a simple ascii table, you can pipe the output
  into **tabplot**:

.. code-block::

   % orbsos orb1.long y | tabplot - 3 4  xlab=Y ylab=VY
   % orbsos orb1.long x | tabplot - 3 4  xlab=X ylab=VX


will plot either a Y-VY or X-VX surface of section.

- **orbdim**
  computes the dimensionality of an orbit, i.e.  how
  many integrals of motions it has.  Although it requires very long
  integration times to accurately compute this, it is completely
  automatic, and does not require an analysis like that for a surface of
  section (which is also graphic).  It is based on an interesting paper
  by Carnevali & Santangelo (1984, ApJ 281 473-476).


- **otos** transforms an orbit back into a snapshot, thereby giving you
  the much richer set of analysis tools that are available for
  {\it snapshot}'s.
