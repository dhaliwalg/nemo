Graphics and Image Display
==========================

NEMO programs also need to display their data of course.
We shall make
a distinction between {\it graphics} and {\it image} data.  A simple but
flexible {\it graphics} interface has been defined in NEMO and is used
extensively in programs.  

To display {\it image} data we rely mostly (but see {\tt ccdplot})
on external software.
Often images would need to be copied to a FITS file for this (but see 
{\tt nds9}).


The YAPP graphics interface
---------------------------

The programs in NEMO which use graphics are rather simple and allow no
interactive processing, except perhaps for a simple 'hit-the-return-key'
or 'push-a-mouse-button' between successive plots or actions.  A very
simple interface (API) was defined ({\bf yapp}, Yet Another Plotting Package)
with basic plot functions.  \index{yapp}
There are currently a few yapp implementations
available, such as a postscript-only device, and pgplot.  
If your output device is not supported by the ones available
in the current yapp directory
({\tt \$NEMO/src/kernel/yapp}), you have to write a new one!  A
reasonably experienced programmer writes a functional yapp-interface in
a few hours.

Although this method results in a flexible graphics interface, a
program can currently only be linked with one yapp-interface.  This might
result in the existence of more than one version of the same
program, each for another graphics output device.  We use the 
convention that the ones for a
postscript printer have a {\tt \_ps} appended to their original name: the 
program which has the original name is the one whose display is the current
screen,
Hence we may see program names such as {\tt snapplot} (general Sun screen
within suntools), {\tt snapplot\_ps} (postscript), \index{snapplot, families}
{\tt snapplot\_cg} (color Sun screen) and {\tt snapplot\_sv}
(variable size sunview pixwindow for storing small images for movies).
Again: actual names may differ on your system.

If programs are linked with the multiplexing libraries
{\it yapp\_mongo}\index{mongo}
or {\it yapp\_pgplot}\index{pgplot}
interface, several device drivers are transparently present through
mongo, and the hidden system keyword {\tt yapp=} is then used to select
a device (a default can be set by using the {\bf YAPP} environment
variable).  \index{yapp=, system keyword} \index{YAPP, environment} See
also Appendix~\ref{a:iface}. 

However, despite these grim sounding words, we currently
almost exclusively use the PGPLOT implementation\index{pgplot} of yapp.

General Graphics Display
------------------------

Another convenient way to present data in graphical form is by using
the table format. We have already encountered the {\it tables} created by
many NEMO programs. These tables can be used by NEMO programs
such as {\it tabplot(1)}, {\it tabhist(1)}, and other packages
such as {\it mongo(1L)}, {\it sm(1L)} and 
{\it gnuplot(1L)},
\index{mongo} but \index{sm} even by completely foreign
packages such as xgobi{\index{xgobi}, grace\index{grace}, 
and xgraphic\index{xgraphic}.
Binary tables need to be converted to ASCII of course.

Image Display Interface
-----------------------

Data in {\it image(5NEMO)} format \index{image(5)} can be transferred in
{\it fits(5NEMO)} format and subsequently displayed and analyzed within
any astronomical image processing system.  They are generally much
better equipped to display and manipulate data of this kind of format. 
A number of standalone display programs can also understand FITS
format.  \index{fits(5)} An excellent example of this is 
{\it ds9(1L)}, although it understands FITS files, can be used in
a client-server setting and NEMO image files can be directly sent
to the display server (a temporary fits file is created, which
can have drawbacks):
